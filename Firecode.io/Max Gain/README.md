Given an list of integers, write a method - max_gain - that returns the maximum gain. Maximum Gain is defined as the maximum difference between 2 elements in a list such that the larger element appears after the smaller element. If no gain is possible, return 0.

Example:
max_gain([100,40,20,10]) ==> 0
max_gain([0,50,10,100,30]) ==> 100
